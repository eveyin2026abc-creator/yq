"""detect_nic.py - Look up a NIC name (nic_name) from an IP address, without relying on the ip / ifconfig commands.

A node may not have iproute2 installed (no `ip` command), but it always has Python, so
all NIC name detection goes through this script. Two detection paths are tried in order:

1. pyroute2 (if installed on the node): goes through netlink and can see every address
   on a given NIC (including secondary / alias addresses);
2. Pure standard library: enumerate NICs with socket.if_nameindex() (falling back to
   /proc/net/dev), then read each NIC's IPv4 address with ioctl(SIOCGIFADDR) and
   compare them one by one. Needs nothing but Python itself, so it works on nodes with
   no third-party libraries installed.

This script is deliberately **self-contained** (it imports no other module from the
package), so it can be uploaded to a remote node and run on its own:

    python3 detect_nic.py 192.168.1.100

On success stdout contains only the NIC name (so callers can use it directly); on
failure it writes to stderr and exits non-zero.
