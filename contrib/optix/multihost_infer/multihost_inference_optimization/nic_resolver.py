"""nic_resolver.py - Detect the NIC name (nic_name) matching each node's IP before optimization starts.

Background: a node may not have iproute2 installed (no `ip` command), so the startup
scripts can no longer detect the NIC name on the spot with `ip -o addr show`. Every node
does have Python, though, so detection happens uniformly **before the startup scripts
are generated**:

- node (master): same machine as the optimizer, so detect_nic.get_ifname_by_ip is
  called directly in-process;
- work (workers): detect_nic.py is uploaded to the remote node, run with that node's own
  Python, and the NIC name is read back from stdout (in docker mode it is run inside the
  container first, falling back to the host on failure).

Results are cached per host in the module-level _NIC_CACHE, so the whole optimization run
pays the SSH cost only during the first cycle and later cycles hit the cache.

Nodes that explicitly configure nic_name in config.toml are not probed; the configured
value is used as-is (a manual setting has the highest precedence).
