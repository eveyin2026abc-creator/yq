"""Nightly marks that cannot be attached on the test method itself.

``parameterized.expand`` on unittest ``TestCase`` cannot take per-case
``pytest.param(marks=...)`` (pytest forwards mark node ids as extra positional
args; see ``tests/regression/tensor_cast/test_parameterized_pytest_param_compat.py``).
Method-level ``@pytest.mark.nightly`` is also not copied onto the generated
``test_*_N_...`` node ids.

Cases that can use ``@pytest.mark.nightly`` or native ``pytest.param(..., marks=)``
are marked at the test site and are intentionally absent here.

Sibling expand parameters that stayed under 4m30s are also absent.
